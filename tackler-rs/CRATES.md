# Tackler-NG: Rusty Services

[Tackler](https://tackler.e257.fi/) is fast, reliable bookkeeping tool 
with native GIT SCM support for plain text accounting, written in Rust.

These are Rusty Services for [Tackler CLI](https://crates.io/crates/tackler).

The Rusty Services are assorted bits and pieces which are needed for 
Tackler, but won't fit into the domain of plain text accounting.
