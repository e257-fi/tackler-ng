== Project Status

Tackler-NG is basis of all Tackler development. It's
in link:https://tackler.e257.fi/features/[feature] parity
and beyond of the old Scala code base.

[NOTE]

== How to build Tackler CLI application

Get the source code and test cases to play around and for building `main`:

----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/e257-fi/tackler-ng
----

Then build the tackler binary:

----
cd tackler-ng

# The main branch should build and pass all tests.
# To build a release, check relased versions:
git tag -l

# Get the release, e.g. v25.01.1
git checkout v25.01.1

# Build tackler
cargo build --release --locked --bin tackler

# the binary is located at 'target/release/tackler'
----

=== Simple example with Filesystem Journal

----
target/release/tackler --config examples/simple.toml
----

=== Complex example with Git Storage and Audit mode

Audit example uses Git SCM as journal storage, and strict and audit modes are activated by configuration.

----
target/release/tackler --config examples/audit.toml
----

Audit test data has a branch with 100_000 transactions, this query will execute in few seconds:

----
target/release/tackler \
   --config examples/audit.toml \
   --input.git.ref txns-1E5 \
   --accounts 'a:ay2016:am12'
----
