=== Transaction set checksum

Transaction set checksum (txn set checksum) is secure and cryptographically strong hash 
and proof of presence of transactions which are used to do accounting calculations.

Txn set checksum is based on UUID of Txn, and it is hash function's result of those UUIDs.
Hash is calculated so that it is possible to verify it easily with external tools.
See link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/[Journal Format] and description of Transaction metadata.

Txn set checksum is calculated based on following algorithm:

* Txn's UUIDs are collected as canonical 8-4-4-4-12 lower case hexadecimal strings.
* Sorted list of UUID stings is fed to hash function so that each UUID is separated
  with single newline (`'\n'`, ASCII `0x0A`) character.
* Resulting hash function hash is Txn Set Checksum

See xref:../../contrib[contrib] for example script (xref:../../contrib/txn-set-checksum.sh[txn-set-checksum.sh])
how to calculate that with standard UNIX command line tools.


==== Assumptions and Restrictions

Each transaction must have unique UUID. Presence of UUID and uniqueness are enforced.

Txn set checksum verifies that same set of transactions (UUIDs) is used for calculations,
but it does *not* verify actual content of used transactions.  If and when content verification is needed,
then link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/git-storage/[Tackler's git storage backend] could be used for that.  In that case,
content verification is done by combining reported git's `commit id` and `txn set checksum`.
Together `commit id` and `txn set checksum` creates tamper proof verification of used transaction data.

To re-verify previous tackler report, it is possible to use git commit id (from old report) as an input reference.
See 
link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/usage/[Usage Guide] 
and 
link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/git-storage/[Git Storage Guide] 
for further info.


=== Report account selector checksum

Report account selectors `core.reporting.accounts` and `core.reports.<report-type>.accounts` are used
to select which accounts are included into reports. Selected accounts affect calculated and reported totals.

Report account selector checksum is secure and cryptographically strong hash of account selector, e.g.
it can be used as fingerprint of used account selector.

Account selector checksum is calculated based on following algorithm:

* Sorted list of account selectors is fed to hash function (e.g. SHA-256)
  so that each selector is separated with single newline (`'\n'`, ASCII `0x0A`) character.
* Resulting hash is Account Selector Checksum



== Journal file format

No changes to journal format are needed.


== Implementation


=== CLI changes

No changes to CLI args are needed.


=== CONF changes

New configuration group for `core`:

* [x] group: 'auditing'
** [x] String: `hash` link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#MessageDigest[JavaSE Tech notes, Security]
** [x] boolean: `txn-set-checksum`

If `txn-set-checksum` is true, then all transactions must have valid `:uuid:`-metadata field.
See 
link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/journal/format/[Journal Format] 
for further info.


=== Machinery

Following changes are needed

* [x] enforce uuid
** [x] Verify presence of UUID at parse time
** [x] Hard error if UUID is missing  during txn set checksum calculation +
       This is either internal error or logic error within usage of link:https://tackler.e257.fi/docs/server-api/[Server API]
* [x] calculate txn set checksum
* [x] calculate account selector checksum

Tackler supports hash functions provided by Java platform, most notably `SHA-256` ... `SHA-512` algorithms on Java 8,
and `SHA3-256` ... `SHA3-512` on Java 11+.
