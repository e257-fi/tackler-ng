= TEP-1014: Equity Export Features and Enhancements

New features and enhancements for Equity export


== Summary

Summary of changes

* Cfg key to set equity transaction's target account
* Print out actual value for equity posting - don't use implicit (last posting's empty) value for it
* Print out warning, if equity transaction zeros out without equity posting
* Indent equity transaction same amount as identity export (3 spaces)


=== CFG key to set Equity transaction's target account

Add new configuration key (`exports.equity.equity-account`) to the tackler.conf. Value of this key will be used as-is for equity transaction's target account, if it's set in configuration.

If equity target account is provided by configuration and strict mode is enabled, then it is validated with Chart of Accounts.

When there is no configuration setting for equity target account, then current default (`Equity:Balance`) is used for target account and it is *NOT* validated with Chart of Accounts. It is not validated regardless if strict mode is activated or not. This is default behaviour of pre TEP-1014 tackler.


=== Explicit value for equity posting

Change Equity target account posting from implicit value to explicit value, e.g. print actual amount to balance transaction. This posting amount, as all other Equity transaction's postings are with full available scale (e.g. scale settings do not have any effect for equity exports).


=== Warning in case of zero sum equity transaction

Insert warning into generated equity transaction in case that sum of postings is zero. This is an error probably in most cases.


=== Indent same as Identity export

Indent equity transaction with three spaces, this is same amount as with identity export.
