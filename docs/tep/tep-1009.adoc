== TEP-1009: Transaction Header Syntax

Change Transaction header format so that it is more robust, regular
and less error prone for humans to manipulate.

== Summary

Currently Tackler's format tries to mimic Ledger's format, and be as much
compatible with it as possible. However, ledger's journal format is somewhat fuzzy,
and makes it unnecessarily difficult to detect some error cases.

For example, currently following invalid ISO-8601 offset (one extra space)
is recognized as start of txn description, not as an offset.

....
2019-03-01T12:00:00 -04:00 Description
....

Technically it's invalid ISO-8601 timestamp, but it would be nice if this
very probable human error could be spotted by tackler.

Same goes on with various not-so-obvious format errors with code field.
These are easy to handle with automatically generated transactions, but
for humans these are really confusing and error prone.

It doesn't help, that tackler won't notice these as an error.

Trying to fix  these with ledger-compatible way leads to overly
complicated grammar rules and some of the resulting rules are ambiguous.


=== Solution

Break compatibility with Ledger as needed, and change the grammar
to be more regular and less error prone.

This will cause that there will be following changes to journal format,
which are breaking changes with old journal format and data.


Transaction description::

Transaction description must start with `'` -prefix.
This is breaking change to journal format.


Transaction code::

Transaction code can not contain characters: +
`'` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>` +
This is breaking change to journal format, if these characters are used in code field.


Transaction metadata::

Transaction metadata must start with `#` + space -prefix, instead of `;:`.
This is breaking change to journal format.


=== Execution


==== Phase 1

Release version of Tackler  which accepts old version and new version,
but emits only new syntax (equity, identity exports).  Mark old syntax to deprecated
on all documentation etc.


=== Phase 2

Drop support for old syntax.


== Journal file format



Transaction description::

Transaction description must start with `'` -prefix.


Transaction code::

Transaction code can not contain characters: +
`'` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>`


Transaction metadata::

Transaction medadata (uuid) must start with ``#`` + space -prefix


== Implementation

=== CLI changes

None


=== CONF changes

None


=== Machinery

Changes to machinery

* [x] Transition
** [x] In phase 1, it must accept old and new format
** [x] After phase 2, only new format will be accepted
* [x] Changes to Grammar and CTX-handlers
* [x] All test and reference vectors have to be updated (also those inside GIT repositories)


==== API changes

None


===== Server API changes

None


===== Client API changes

None


==== New dependencies

None


=== Reporting

This change causes modifications to Register report.


==== Balance report

None


==== Balance Group report

None


==== Register report

Register report has to be changed due this change.

Without change to register report it would  be impossible to identify following two
transactions correctly from register-report.

The first one has code '#123', and the second one has txn with description '(#123)'.

....
2019-03-01 (#123)
 a 1
 b

2019-03-01 '(#123)
 a 1
 b
....

With current register report, both will look exactly same,
and it would impossible e.g. to select correct filters.

=> Change register report so that it prefix description with `'`

Register report also prints transaction UUID. For overall consistency,
it would be good to have same syntax for uuid in register report,
as there is with journal.

=> Change register report so that will prefix metadata with `#`


=== Exporting

Equity and Identity exports must be valid input to tackler, hence both must be changed.

==== Equity export

Change equity export so that it will use `'` for description.


==== Identity export

Change identity export so that it will use `'` for description, and `#` for metadata.


=== Documentation

* [x] xref:./readme.adoc[]: Update TEP index
* [x] link:../../CHANGELOG[]: add new item
* [x] Does it warrant own T3DB file?
** [x] update xref:../../tests/tests.adoc[]
** [x] update link:../../tests/check-tests.sh[]
** [x] Add new T3DB file link:../../tests/tests-1009.yml[]
* [x] User docs
** [x] Journal format
** [x] All examples


=== Future plans and Postponed (PP) features

Following characters are reserved for future use in header's first line: `[` `]` `{` `}` `<` `>`

Extending current metadata data (uuid) to actual metadata header block (e.g. several lines).


==== Postponed (PP) features

Nothing


=== Tests

Normal, ok-case tests to validate functionality:

===== Phase 1

* [x] Accepts old syntax
** [x] Txn header without `'`-prefix
** [x] code field with reserved characters
** [x] Txn metadata with `;:`
** [x] All output is on new syntax

* [x] Accepts new syntax
** [x] Txn header with `'`-prefix
** [x] Txn metadata with `#` + space
***  [x] Test Txn metadata with `#` + multiple space

* [x] Test vector to validate that old format is still accepted
** [x] description without `'`
** [x] code with special characters
** [x] old `;:` metadata format



===== Phase 2

* [x] Rejects old syntax
** [x] Txn header without `'`-prefix
** [x] code field with reserved characters
** [x] Txn metadata with `;:`

* [x] Accepts new syntax
** [x] Txn header with `'`-prefix
** [x] Txn metadata with `#`

* [x] Enable all tests ("todo: perr:" and ignored suites)


==== Errors

Error case tests for Phase-1 and Phase-2.

===== Phase 1

* [x] e: incorrect metadata syntax


===== Phase 2

* [ ] Rejects old syntax
** [ ] e: Txn header without `'`-prefix
** [ ] e: code field with reserved characters
** [ ] e: Txn metadata with `;:`



==== Perf

No need for new perf tests - change is covered by normal perf suite.
