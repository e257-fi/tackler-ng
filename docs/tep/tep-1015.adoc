= TEP-1015: Price data support

Add price data support for currencies, shares and commodities.

Github issue: https://github.com/tackler-ng/tackler/issues/36

== Summary

There are three different use cases for initial price data support:

1. Current valuation of commodities, shares and currencies
2. Historical valuation of commodities, shares and currencies, at certain point in time
3. Simulation with historical price data. For example
    .. Historical purchasing power of money analysis
    .. Market value analysis of produced commodity (e.g. electricity)

=== Price Data lookup types

1. Last recorded rate in PriceDB
2. Before given timestamp
3. At transaction time or nearest before the txn time


==== Fixed conversions

This TEP-1015 does not propose any method for calculating the fixed conversions (e.g. oz to g, gallons to litres, etc).


==== Inverted prices

At the moment inverted prices are not supported. With following PriceDB, conversion from `USD` to `EUR` is not supported.

.PriceDB with no USD to EUR rate
----
P 2025-01-07 EUR 1.3 USD
----

For USD to EUR conversion, there must be an own entry for the inverted rate in the price db:

.PriceDB with inverted rate
----
P 2025-01-07 EUR 1.3 USD
P 2025-01-07 USD 0.77 EUR ; 1/1.3 ~ 0.7692; Normally there is official inverted rate
----


==== Price conversion chains

Price conversions chains are not supported. For example, this conversion from EUR to USD via SEK and NOK is not supported:

.PriceDB without direct EUR to USD rate
----
P 2025-01-07 EUR 11.50 SEK
P 2025-01-07 SEK  1.02 NOK
P 2025-01-07 NOK  0.09 USD ; EUR->SEK-NOK->USD = 1.055700; The real rate is 1.02
----

If this would be allowed, it would substantially complicate conversion and rate applying logic and could produce surprising results, especially when mixed with direct conversion rates.



=== Price Data application policy

`last-price` and `given-time`::
1. Used Price is based on rates noted in the pricedb. Possible costs recorded in the transactions are ignored.
2. If there are multiple rates in the pricedb for the same commodity, the latest applicable is used (applicable by price lookup type).

`txn-time`::
1. Used Price is based on rates noted in the pricedb. Possible costs recorded in the transactions are ignored.
2. The price rate, which has the same time as the transaction or the latest rate before transaction time, is used.


[#historic-with-filters]
==== Historic price data with filters

Let's assume there are following price data entries (three entries per year, distributed evenly):

----
P 2024-03-31 ACME 240331.00 USD
P 2024-06-30 ACME 240630.00 USD
P 2024-09-30 ACME 240930.00 USD
P 2024-12-31 ACME 241231.00 USD
----

Today is 2025-01-01 and we run filtering query which will include txns from (inclusive - exclusive) range `[ 2024-01-01 .. 2024-04-01 [` into our reports.

If we like to use the same conversion rate, which was used when the `2024/Q1` report was generated, the price data lookup type should be `2. Before given timestamp` with the same value as filter's end time `--report.price-before=2024-04-01`.

The used price data for reporting would be 240331.00 USD, (the `P 2024-03-31 ACME 240331.00 USD` entry), which is the nearest earlier recorded price in the Price DB.  This will ensure that reported values are same, regardless if the report is run on 2024-04-01 or 2025-01-01.

There is future option to do this automatically, see xref:filtering[].


== Journal File Format

No change would be made to the journal file format. A new file type would be added with a format similar to the default format of Ledger CLI as described https://ledger-cli.org/doc/ledger3.html[here].

----
'P' TIMESTAMP COMMODITY AMOUNT COMMODITY OPT_COMMENT
----

Where OPT_COMMENT is prefixed with `';' space+`, this is similar as Txn comments.

For example:
----
P 2025-01-07 EUR 1.0393 USD ; as reported by Central Bank of Europe
----

There are some existing usage for this format:

* link:https://github.com/kantord/pricedb[pricedb -project]
* link:https://hledger.org/1.41/hledger.html#p-directive[hledger P-directive]

=== Timestamp handling

The `timestamp` will use the same logic as transaction timestamps:

* RFC3339 timestamp with offset information
* Timestamp without zone or offset, then the `kernel.timestamp.timezone` value is used as zone/offset.
* Date, then `kernel.timestamp.default-time` is used with `kernel.timestamp.timezone`.

The resulting timestamp is always with offset.


== Implementation

=== CLI Changes

New command line switch to activate price data, this could be implemented later.

`--price.db-path`:: Path to the price data file

`--price.lookup-type`:: Price lookup type, valid values are:
* `none`
* `last-price`
* `txn-time`
* `given-time`

`--price.before <ts>`:: Date or timestamp to be used in price lookup, see also xref:fppf[].
* This is valid option only with `last-price` or `given-time` price lookup types.
* This is exclusive time, e.g. the first price db entry before this time is used.
* If `ts` is date, then `kernel.timestamp.default-time`
and `kernel.timestamp.timezone` is used for timestamp.
* If `ts` has date and time, but it's missing offset/zone information, then `kernel.timestamp.timezone` is used.


`--report.commodity`:: Commodity to be used in reports


=== CONF Changes

New configuration keys for pricedb functionality:

----
[price]
### this is similar as `accounts`, `commodidities` and `tags`.
### "none" means that no price data is loaded.
### In that case also `price.lookup-type` must be "none".
###
### To temporaryly disable price data functionality,
### use CONF and CLI switch `price.lookup-type  = "none"`
###
db-path = "path/to/price.db"
###
### Price lookup type
###
### Valid values are:
###   - "none"
###   - "last-price"
###   - "txn-time"
###   - "given-time", with this CLI `--price.before` must be used
###
lookup-type = "txn-time"

[report]
###
### Target commodity in reports
###
commodity = "TCKLR"
----

[#filtering]
=== Filtering Changes

Future change:

Add extra attribute to TxnFilter definition `end_ts`, to define which price data will be used with reports when using filtering and restricting reporting to past dates.


=== Machinery

Changes to machinery

* [ ] Add a new model _PriceEntry_ with fields
  - timestamp with offset
  - source commodity (with inferred amount 1)
  - target commodity with rate
  - optional comment

The `report.report-timezone` is used to convert price data to displayed zone in the reports.


==== API Changes

Api changes to server or client interfaces.

* [ ] Future: `end_ts` attribute in `tackler_api::filters::FilterDefinition`

===== JSON Model

Changes to JSON model

Reporting price and commodity conversion related data in:

* [ ] Metadata
* [ ] JSON Reports
    ** [ ] BalanceReport
    ** [ ] BalanceGroupReport
    ** [ ] RegisterReport


==== New Dependencies

No new dependencies

=== Reporting

Changes to reports or reporting

The used prices are reported as part of the Metadata section of the report, when single rate for particular conversion is used. In case of `txn-time`, variable cost bases will be noted in the metadata.

Future: This could be behind a switch in the future, so that this can be turned off, especially in the case that there are many commodities / prices to be reported.

==== Balance Report

Changes to balance report

* [ ] item


==== Balance Group Report

[#balgrp-price-data]
===== Sub-Group price data

This implementation uses the same logic as Balance Report, e.g. single price value is used for all sub-groups with `last-price` and `given-time` price lookup types. There could be an conf/cli option to change this in the future, so that each sub-group could have their own price data based on time to used to greate that group.

[#fppf]
=== Future Plans and Postponed (PP) Features

How and where to go from here?

* Maybe support for price conversion chains? (`EUR` -> `SEK` -> `NOK` -> `USD`)

* Fixed, constant conversions (e.g. oz to g, gallons to litres, etc)

* More options to select used price data based on time:
  ** `--price.after`
  ** `--price.at` (exact time, with `--price.resolution`)
  ** `--price.resolution` (e.g. 1h, 1d, 1w, 1m, 1y)

* Inferred prices by recorded costs in transactions
  ** Option for `txn-time` to use inferred prices


[#future-price-date]
==== Used Price date

CLI/CONF option to define machine how price data will be used with reports when using filtering and restricting reporting to past dates, see also xref:filtering[].

Possible idea-level options could be:

* Latest recorded value in PriceDB
* Latest available price before given filter or timestamp (e.g. `--report.price-before=2024-05-01`)
* Next, nearest future price
* Linear fitting between nearest past and nearest future prices


==== Postponed (PP) Features

Anything which wasn't implemented?

* xref:filtering[]
* xref:balgrp-price-data[]


=== Tests

* [x] strict-mode
    ** [x] On
    ** [x] Off (without commodities)

* [x] txn with empty commodities when price conv is activated

* [x] No conversion
    ** [x] commodity but no conversion activated
    ** [x] Secondary account with non-conv commodity (val-pos notation)

* [x] Selecting correct price by time
    ** [x] at-txn

        *** [x] Conv: a -> TCKLR, b->TCKLR, etc.
    ** [-] Each Balance-Group have different conversion value
        *** [-] filter: group-selector == txn-ts-end (Is this desired behaviour?)

* [x] Metadata testing
    ** [x] Fixed conv rate, multiple commodities, different ts

        *** [x] Second resolution

* [x] Target commodity not found (at all) in pricedb

* [x] Transaction commodity is same as target commodity (recorded cost / unit price in target commodity)

==== Errors

Various error cases:

* [x] e: no source to target conversion in pricedb
* [x] e: TS with LookupType != GivenTime
* [x] e: GivenTime, no TS


==== Perf

Is there need to run or create new perf tests?

* [ ] Old tests, no conversion
    ** [ ] Old tests, activated conversion, no match
* [ ] New perf data with commodity
    ** [ ] Perf with conversion
* [ ] Perf benchmark (cargo bench) for PriceDB + Cache
    ** [ ] 10, 100, 1000, 10_000 commodities
            (ECB publish rates for 37 currencies, NYSE has ~3k companies)
