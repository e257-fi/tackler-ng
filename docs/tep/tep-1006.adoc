= TEP-1006: CFG settings for report output scale

Support configuration settings for report output scale.

Report scale settings will control how many decimals will be used 
in minimum and at maximum to output report's values.


== Journal file format

None


== CLI changes

Precision setting is not supported by CLI argument.


== CONF changes

Changes to conf-settings

* [x] Global settings
** [x] min value
** [x] max value
* [x] Report spesific settings
** [x] min value
** [x] max value


== Machinery

Changes to machinery

* [x] Settings min-scale
* [x] Settings max-scale
* [x] ReportLike / Reporter changes to support report specific scale


=== API changes

No API changes to server or client interfaces.


==== Server API changes

No changes.


==== Client API changes

No changes.


=== New dependencies

No new dependencies.


== Reporting

Changes to reports or reporting


=== Balance report

Changes to balance report

* [x] scale.min
* [x] scale.max


=== Balance Group report

Changes to balance group report

* [x] scale.min
* [x] scale.max


=== Register report

Changes to register report

* [x] scale.min
* [x] scale.max


== Exporting

All export formats use full scale at the moment. For this reason it is not
possible to define used output scale for equity or identity exports.

== Documentation

* [x] xref:../../CHANGELOG[]: add new item
* [x] User docs
** [x] tackler.conf
*** [x] global settings
**** [x] `reporting.scale.min`
**** [x] `reporting.scale.max`
*** [x] report spesific settings
**** [x] balance
***** [x] `reports.balance.scale.min`
***** [x] `reports.balance.scale.max`
**** [x] balance-group
***** [x] `reports.balance-group.scale.min`
***** [x] `reports.balance-group.scale.max`
**** [x] register
***** [x] `reports.register.scale.min`
***** [x] `reports.register.scale.max`


== Future plans and Postponed (PP) features

Any needs for Server API to set report output scale per report?


=== Postponed (PP) features

None at the moment


== Tests

Normal, ok-case tests to validate functionality:

* [x] Set global
** [x] old 2-7
** [x] something else, e.g. 1-3
* [x] Iterate over all report settings with report specific settings


=== Errors

Various error cases:

* [x] e: maxScale is smaller than minScale
* [x] e: minScale is negative
* [x] e: maxScale is negative
* [-] e: minScale is too large (Used data type is arbitrary precision number)
* [-] e: maxScale is too large (Used data type is arbitrary precision number)


=== Perf

Should not affect performance.
