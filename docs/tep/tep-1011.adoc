= TEP-1011: Transaction Tags

Add support for Transaction Tags and Filters

== Summary

Transaction tags are valueless keywords or category names,
which can be attached to the transaction's metadata.

Summary of changes

* Transaction tags
* Transaction tag filters


=== Transaction tags

There could be multiple tags for single transaction
and tags can have a hierarchy in similar way as accounts have.

[IMPORTANT]
.Amendment to this TEP-1011
====
Duplicate tags are not allowed in transaction tags set.
====

Transaction tags must be predefined if strict mode for tags is activated.


=== Transaction tag filters

Transaction Tag Filter selects transactions which any tag matches specified regular expression.


== Journal file format

Syntax support for Transaction Tags:

* Same syntax as with accounts (tags and sub-tags)


== Implementation

=== CLI changes

No Changes to command line interface in the first phase.
Searching and filtering by tags will be supported by normal filter api.


=== CONF changes

Changes to conf-settings

* [x] Strict settings for tags

=== Filtering changes

Transaction Tag Filter selects transactions with any tag matches specified regular expression.

----
{
  "TxnFilterTxnTags" : {
    "regex" : "<regex>"
  }
}
----

If multiple tags should or must be matched then this should be done by using logical filter combinators
and multiple txn tag filters.
