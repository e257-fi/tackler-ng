= Tackler-NG

Tackler’s operations and results must always be correct and
trustworthy. If there are any errors with journal, then it will fail
fast and hard and won’t process dubious input as valid one.

Tackler-NG will strive for the same

== Unsafe and unwrap

Unsafe code is forbidden in the code base.

All `unwrap` usage should be documented, either why they won't panic or why it doesn't matter.

`rg 'unwrap\(' | egrep -v '(:ok:)|(:test:)'`


== Rust toolchain

Used Rust toolchain is the latest or fairly new version of Rust.


== Number types: TacklerReal vs. rust_decimal

TacklerReal::
Scala's https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.10/scala/math/BigDecimal.html[Scala BigDecimal] with unlimited
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html#UNLIMITED[MathContext], with https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html#HALF_UP[HALF_UP] rounding mode.

Rust_decimal::
Decimal represents a 128 bit representation of a fixed-precision decimal number. The finite set of values of type Decimal are of the form m / 10^e, where m is an integer such that -2^96 < m < 2^96, and e is an integer between 0 and 28 inclusive.


== Design and Code Structure

At the moment design and code structure follows Tackler's structure:

* link:https://github.com/tackler-ng/tackler/blob/main/docs/devel/design.adoc[Design]
* link:https://github.com/tackler-ng/tackler/blob/main/docs/tep/readme.adoc[TEP Index (Tackler Enhancement Proposals)]


=== Parser definition

Tackler-NG uses link:https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/index.html[winnow] parser combinator library for parsing.

Parser functions are defined in the link:../../tackler-core/src/parser/parts[parser::parts] module.

There is an old, ANTLR based grammar and lexer definition available.

* Grammar: link:./antlr/TxnParser.g4[ANTLR TxnParser.g4]
* Lexer: link:./antlr/TxnLexer.g4[ANTLR TxnLexer.g4].
* Contex handlers: link:./antlr/ctx_handler.rs[ANTLR Context Handlers]

These are only used as reference and preserved for historic reasons.


== Running Tests

The Just  is preferred way to run tests, see link:../../justfile[justfile] for details.

If you don't have just installed already, it's just `cargo install just` (there might be a pun involved here).

The `just --list` will display various targets and aliases for those.
