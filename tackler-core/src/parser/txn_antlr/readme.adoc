= Tackler Txn Parser Grammar and Lexer definitions

This directory contains link:./TxnParser.g4[grammar] and link:./TxnLexer.g4[lexer]
definitions for Tackler. Parser definition is generated with
link:https://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR]. The Rust target for ANTLR is located on
here: https://github.com/rrevenantt/antlr4rust.

Directory contains also generated transient parser implementation files
and a patch file to fix warnings in the generated files.
These generated files are overwritten when the parser is regenerated.


== How to Regenerate Tackler Txn Parser Definitions

1. Get link:https://github.com/rrevenantt/antlr4rust/releases[ANTLR with Rust target] (Download jar file from that page and store it so that link:make-parser.sh[] finds it, default location is at temp directory next to the working copy directory)
1. Generate parser by running: `sh make-parser.sh`
