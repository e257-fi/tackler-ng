### Configuration settings for Tackler-NG
###
### The format of this file TOML (https://toml.io/en/)
[kernel]
### Stric mode
###
### When this is true, then all accounts, commodities and tags
### must be predefined.  If there is an undefined item,
### it's fatal halting error.
###
### Valid options are: true | false
strict = true

### Configuration Options for Timestamp
[kernel.timestamp]
### Default time value for timestamps
###
### This time value is used for timestamp if it's only
### on date granularity, e.g. "2024-11-15".
###
### See also "kernel.timestamp.timezone" and "report.report-timezone"
### about transaction timezones and txn timestamps on reports.
default-time = 00:00:00

### Default Timezone of Timestamp
[kernel.timestamp.timezone]
### Default timezone which is used with timestamp
### if it does not have timezone info.
###
### See also "report.report-timezone" about
### timestamp presentation on reports.
###
### Format is either zone's offset or name of ZoneID entry
### (IANA Time Zone Database), for example:
###    name = "GMT", "UTC", "Europe/Helsinki"
### or
###    offset = "+02:00",
###
### If timezone is offset, then timestamp is not adjusted based on
### daylight saving time.
###
### If timezone is zone name, then it is adjusted according
### the DST rules for that zone.
###
### offset = "+02:00"
###    2016-01-01T00:00:00 => 2016-01-01T00:00:00+02:00
###    2016-06-25T00:00:00 => 2016-06-25T00:00:00+02:00
###
### timezone = "Europe/Helsinki"
###    2016-01-01T00:00:00 => 2016-01-01T00:00:00+02:00
###    2016-06-25T00:00:00 => 2016-06-25T00:00:00+03:00
###
### It's an error to have both defined at the same time.
name = "Europe/Helsinki"
#offset = "-07:00"

### Settings related to audit features
[kernel.audit]
### Hash algorithm
###
### Supported hash algorithms are:
###   SHA-256, SHA-512/256, SHA-512
###   SHA3-256, SHA3-512
hash = "SHA-256"
### Audit mode
###
### This turns audit mode on or off.
### When audit mode is on,
### then also strict checking is on.

mode = true



### Transaction Input Configuration
[kernel.input]
### Type of input storage system
###
### Valid options are: "fs" | "git"
storage = "fs"

### Filesystem based input storage
[kernel.input.fs]
### Top-level directory of storage tree
###
### This is the top level location of txn shard structure,
### the scanning is started from here.
###
### If the directory path is relative, then it's based on this file.
### In case of CLI option, it's relative to the current working directory.
###
### CLI: --input.fs.dir
dir = "txns"
### Filename suffix
###
### This is transaction file extension, e.g. all files with
### this suffix are included into input.
###
### CLI: --input.fs.ext
suffix = "txn"

### Git SCM based input storage
[kernel.input.git]
### Path to git repository
###
### This must point to "bare" section of repository, e.g.
###   * to the bare git repository `git clone --bare`
### or
###   * to '.git'-directory inside the normal working tree (clone)
###
### If the repository path is relative, then it's based on this file.
### In case of CLI option, it's relative to the current working directory.
###
### It's possible to have 'kernel.input.fs.dir' pointing working tree,
### and at the same time 'kernel.input.git.repository' to point '.git'
### directory inside that same working tree. Then used storage could be
### selected by 'kernel.input.storage'
###
### CLI: --input.git.repo
repository = "tackler-data.git"
### Git reference name
###
### This is git reference name (ref or symbolic ref). It is used
### to define branch or tag to find transaction data.
### HEAD revision is automatically used for that branch.
###
### This could be a branch or tag name:
###    "main", "cleared", "Y2024", etc.
### See git's documentation for further information about git references.
###
### CLI: --input.git.ref
ref = "main"
### Txn directory inside the repository
###
### This the directory inside git repository where transactions are stored.
### This is a filesystem path "inside repository" and working copy,
### and it is relative to the top of repository (and working copy) root.
###
### CLI: --input.git.dir
dir = "txns"
### Suffix of file names which are processed as transactions.
suffix = "txn"
